# The Prio Server Runtime

The application folder contains all of the components that are necessary for
running a Mozilla-compatible Prio server. The back-ends can be replaced for
different deployment configurations.

## Quickstart

```bash
# build the container
make build

# run the container on localhost
make test

# TODO: deploy the application to GKE
```
